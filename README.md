# Superfusion-Chamber

A superfusion chamber and other parts for use in electrophysiology and neuroimaging studies in vivo. 

Designed by Marat Minlebaev  (marat.minlebaev@inserm.fr)

Marat Minlebaev and colleagues demonstrate the use of the superfusion chamber in a series of studies using optical intrinsic imaging and extracellular and intracellular recordings in the rat barrel cortex. The device is easy and inexpensive to print either in-house or through a 3d-printing service, making this set accessible for virtually any lab.
